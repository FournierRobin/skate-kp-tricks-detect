# Skateboard Tricks Detection and Keypoint Recognition

The goal of this project is to detect skateboards and their keypoints using a fine-tuned YOLOv8 model. This can primarily help classify tricks and provide insights to the user on how to improve their technique.

## Introduction

This project began as a portfolio piece to demonstrate the capabilities of object detection and keypoint recognition models. 
Starting with a focus on a single skateboard design, the aim was to recognize the board and pinpoint specific features on it.
